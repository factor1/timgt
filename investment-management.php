                            <p class="lead">Investment management, also known as portfolio management, is the professional management of various securities and assets to meet specified investment goals for investors. TIM works with you to identify your risk tolerance and recommend a model portfolio to help you achieve specific financial goals, from your working years, straight through to retirement. Our philosophy is to remain invested in a risk appropriate, diversified portfolio during bull phases to capture the most upside possible and apply risk management techniques to raise cash during bearish phases, attempting to protect gains achieved in the previous cycle. In our weekly Investment Committee meeting, we discuss market themes, potential issues on the horizon, evaluate performance and discuss possible adjustments we might need to make to our models.</p>

                            <p>They say, “A picture is worth a thousand words.” Technical analysis consists of studying past market data, which is usually constructed in chart form, by tracking price movement. Technical analysis helps us to determine when to buy and sell a security. Investor psychology has a tendency to repeat itself. By studying the charts, we can find patterns that repeat throughout history, which helps improves our odds of having a successful trade. Total Investment Management has been using technical analysis for over 10 years with the portfolios we manage. While the fundamental data tends to be backward looking, the technicals reflect the current state of the markets. Technical analysis is a great way to control risk. Our long term bear market signals are technically derived and allow us to get defensive before the economists tell us we are in a recession.</p>

                            <p>TIM understands that investment expenses are extremely important when managing money. As such, TIM has been moving their portfolios more and more to Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)&mdash;baskets of stocks that track specific market indexes. There are two major differences between mutual funds and ETFs. ETFs are much less expensive (which means more money in your pocket) and most mutual fund managers cannot consistently beat benchmarked indexes. Therefore, we believe ETFs are the wave of the future and should hold a majority of the positions in your portfolio. Of course, there are mutual funds that have great long-term track records, beat their benchmarks over time and specialize in certain areas. We use these for market areas where we feel we need professional expertise: bonds, alternatives and select equity asset classes. When evaluating these investments, we look at expenses, manager track record, performance and other key factors to develop our positions. Additionally, due to the size of TIM investment positions, we get direct access to fund managers, adding another layer of research individuals typically can’t get on their own. Lastly, we are completely independent, so we look at all possible investment choices for our clients. We have no allegiance to any one firm.</p>

                            <p>The future is unlikely to be a mirror of the past, but reviewing the past offers an understanding of the interaction among important variables and forms a base for making projections. Our fundamental research involves a broader scope known as a “top-down macro approach.” The practice of macro-fundamental analysis begins by determining the state of the economic environment, its impact on industry groups and the implications of that environment for investment decisions. Total Investment Management utilizes fundamental research to develop market expectations and appropriate levels of risk in our asset allocation process. By examining the economic factors such as interest rates, GDP, inflation and employment, we are able to determine the strength of the market and control the appropriate level of exposure to sectors of the global economy throughout business cycles.</p>
