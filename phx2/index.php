                            <p class="lead just">Investment management, also known as portfolio management, is the professional management of various securities and assets to meet specified investment goals for investors. TIM works with you to identify your risk tolerance and recommend a model portfolio to help you achieve specific financial goals, from your working years, straight through to retirement. Our philosophy is to remain invested in a risk appropriate, diversified portfolio during bull phases to capture the most upside possible and apply risk management techniques to raise cash during bearish phases, attempting to protect gains achieved in the previous cycle.</p>
