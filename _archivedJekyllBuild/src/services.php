                            <p class="lead just">Investment management, also known as portfolio management, is the professional management of various securities and assets to meet specified investment goals for investors. TIM works with you to identify your risk tolerance and recommend a model portfolio to help you achieve specific financial goals, from your working years, straight through to retirement. Our philosophy is to remain invested in a risk appropriate, diversified portfolio during bull phases to capture the most upside possible and apply risk management techniques to raise cash during bearish phases, attempting to protect gains achieved in the previous cycle.</p>

                            <p class="just">Many people do not take the time to create an estate plan because they think the task is a difficult one, especially since it requires planning for after they’re gone.  For many, that’s a daunting task and may even seem unnecessary and uncomfortable. REMEMBER:  IF YOU DON’T HAVE AN ESTATE PLAN (EXIT PLAN), THE STATE HAS ONE FOR YOU! Having a well thought out estate plan is generally the most efficient way to transfer your assets to who you want, when you want and how you want, without probate.</p>

                            <p class="just">Insurance can play an important part in a person’s financial plan. While you are younger, you must ensure that your family is taken care of in case you are not there to provide for them. As you approach retirement, insurance needs change. Are annuities an appropriate tool for income and protection ?  Do you need to cover a spouse because you decide to take a certain type of pension election? Can you reduce your coverage because the kids are on their own? What about long-term care insurance? These are questions that can be answered by our insurance consultant.</p>

                            <p class="just">With tuition costs continuing to go up each year it pays to start saving early. Our 529 accounts provide a low cost, transparent way to invest in your children’s or grandchildren’s future. A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged plan designed to encourage savings for higher education expenses. All withdrawals from the 529 accounts are free from federal tax as long as they are used for qualified educational expenses. Saving for college early can help with the increasing cost of education and more importantly ensure that your financial plan remains on track for your retirement.</p>
