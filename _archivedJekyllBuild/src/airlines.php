                                    <p>TIM has been working with United (UAL) Pilots for over 20 years. We have developed a comprehensive retirement solution for Pilots at any stage of their career. Our strategic partnership with Charles Schwab allows us to bring our UAL Pilots the best execution technology for placing trades and managing their portfolios. We utilize the free trading vehicles (ETFs and mutual funds) available to TIM at Charles Schwab to keep costs at a minimum. We know the UAL retirement program better than most advisors because of our long history with UAL and our special focus on assisting aviation industry personnel.

                                    <p>Who is helping you with the most important asset for your retirement? TIM has been working with United Flight Attendants for close to 20 years. Although Flight Attendants have no mandatory retirement date and can continue to work, your 401k is going to be an important piece of your income strategy when you actually do retire. You most likely live a very busy life; do you have the expertise and time to give your serious asset the attention it deserves? We have extensive knowledge about your 401k and a strategic partnership with your custodian to more effectively manage Flight Attendants’ portfolios.

                                    <p>A lot of attention is given to helping Pilots with their retirement but there are so many other people that contribute to an airlines’ success. As such, TIM has investment management programs in place for most other aviation personnel. Whether you are a gate agent, mechanic or in management, TIM can help you manage your most important asset. Most other personnel retirement programs follow the Flight Attendant model where we have extensive knowledge. We have a strategic relationship with your custodian which allows us to more effectively manage your retirement plan than you might be able to do yourself.

Our service provides pro-active investment management of your retirement plans for a very reasonable fee. Not only do we assist Pilots with their 401k Savings Plan, we also will manage the Retirement Savings Plan and any older plans from legacy airlines like America West-- all this included for the same fee.

A lot of subscribers at other airlines that were forced out looked to continue flying with NetJets. Since then, our program has expanded, enabling us to assist all NetJets Pilots. We have developed a comprehensive retirement solution for Pilots at any stage of their career. Our strategic partnership with Charles Schwab allows us to bring our NetJets Pilots the best execution technology for placing trades and managing their portfolios. We utilize the free trading vehicles (mutual funds) available to TIM at Charles Schwab to keep costs at a minimum.
