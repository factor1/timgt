To make things easier, we developed this page as a convenient spot where TIM clients can go, in case they misplaced that important website access information. Below you will find links to your company’s retirement plan, if you are still working, access to your 401k rollover, if you are currently retired or have any outside accounts away from your company plan that we currently manage. We've also included links to the financial planning program for clients who have a working financial plan, and the Weekly Wrap-Up, so you can follow along with the market action each week as we communicate our thoughts on the current market environment.</p>

Remember: we give TIM financial planning clients access to the program so you can make changes or build alternate scenarios to your plan if you choose. Additionally, since your plan resides on a protected server, you can easily access the plan without the need for tons of paper. As part of the Premier program, “financial physicals” will be performed at least annually with your CFP.</p>
